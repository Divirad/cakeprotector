# Instruction

when the Gobls reach the cake you lose the game. You have to prevent as long as possible. 
You have to place the towers on the field and upgrade them tactically. The Gobls follow the way.
Towers can be placed on the remaining open fields (on the gras). 
If an Gobls reaches the end of the path and gets to the cake, he will eat a piece of the cake and the player loses one life. The game is over then, when the Gobls have eaten the whole cake. The goal of the game is to place towers as skillfully and skip as much rounds as possible.
